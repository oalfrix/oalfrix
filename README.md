# 👋 Hey there, I'm Alfrix Omondi  

💻 **Full-stack web dev | Game concept designer | Tech tinkerer | Creative mind from Kenya 🇰🇪**

I love turning wild ideas into functional digital experiences — from **gaming websites that sell in-parts with M-Pesa integration**, to **React-based learning games**, and even **Android system security experiments**.  

When I'm not coding, I’m probably tweaking firmware, optimizing FPS on budget builds, or chilling with **Megan Ruth ❤️**.

### 🚀 What I’m Building  
- 🎮 **Game Store Website** — responsive, Tailwind-powered, automated M-Pesa payments  
- 🤖 **Telegram Bot** — subscription system with STK Push payments  
- 🌍 **Anonymous Social Platform** — a chill, faceless space for nature & art  
- 🧠 **React Game Concept** — teaching JavaScript through play
